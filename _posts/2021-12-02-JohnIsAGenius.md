## Dude - we should listen carefully to what John Cochrane is saying

John Cochrane is a genius. I learn something new every time I read his [blog](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/) or his papers (which have had an enormous impact on economics).

His book, yet to be published is simply amazing. Chapter 18 is really really really good and interesting. He describes the tension between new-keynesian and old-keynesian (think IS-LM) models. While the two models produce equations that look very similar, they have opposing outcomes. In old-keynesian models expectations are backward-looking, while new-keynesian models use rational forward looking expectations. Increasing interest rates in this system produces very different results. 

He shows the following for old-keynesian models:

They produce **determinate** but **destabilizing** paths for inflation if the interest rate responds less than one to one to inflation. Destabilizing forward, but stable backwards.

He shows the following for new-keynesian models:

They produce **indeterminate** but **stabilizing** paths for inflation

He makes it painfully clear that what was missing in the all of the previous discussions was the distinction between instability and indeterminacy. I definitely never thought of the differences much.

Instability refers to the larger eigenvalues that are larger than one, while indeterminacy means multiple equilibria. As an example, when we write out the Blanchard-Kahn conditions for linearized DSGE models we often look at the eigenvalues, we sort them and we say that the number of eigenvalues greater than 1 cannot exceed the number of jump variables (or forward looking equations). If they are, we say that they are indetrminate. But actually, the are just unstable. In fact what we tend to do is select our equilibrium. This is typically the one that does not blow up the system.

He critizes new-keynesian models by showing that we cannot get around selecting the equalibrium unless we add active fiscal policy (to pin down price expectations). Effectively, this overturns standard predictions of IS-LM, which says that if you raise the monetary policy interest rate, then inflation should fall. No, in the attempt to microfound IS-LM, you get the opposite result - a permanent increase in the interest rate **increases** inflation. The only way to reduce inflation in this system is to simultaneously induce a fiscal contraction.
