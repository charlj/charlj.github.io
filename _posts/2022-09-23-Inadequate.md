A short(ish) post about facing one's inadequacies.

# You are inadequate

There are times in one's life that forces you to reflect on mortality. They become more frequent when your body takes longer to heal from injuries or disease. Reflecting on mortality is an odd thing. Some people wish for the end to come faster to escape all the hurt and confusion of being alive. Some find the thought of death as an anxious meditation on the shortcomings of life. And others reflect on the temporal and infinite aspects of life after death.
I am sure a lot of people experience all of these thoughts at some point. However, lately, mortality is making me face my inadequacies. It is too easy to tell yourself to live life to the fullest, to squeeze joy out of every waking moment and to live out experiences such that you reduce future regret. However, I find it more peaceful to reflect on the way I conduct my life, and specifically, how sin permeates my decisions. Fullness of life is not the sum of exciting experiences. It is not minimizing the future fears of missing out losses. Fullness of life is balance at each point in time, without having to stress about your projected self in the future, or without being hindered by your past self. Facing one's inadequacies forces you to define what is inadequate.

Here is what I know in terms of inadequacies. Life experience, and studying others, seems to suggest that we possess an objective moral law encoded into our hearts. Violating those laws brings discomfort and imbalance. But the jig is that it is impossible to maintain those moral laws. Clear examples include the discomfort and the regret that follows when we lie, gossip, cheat or hurt another person. We all lie, gossip, cheat, slander and hurt our friends and enemies. It does not feel great. It would seem that we are incapable of living moral lives. There are a few people who argue that moral objectivity does not exist - but don't let them fool you - they are trying to justify bad behavior. It is bad because fundamentally it hurts them and the people they interact with. People don't trust liars and cheats - they will eventually be excluded from participating in activities and groups as an example.

I also know that it takes an accumulation of violations of a moral law to bring us to a point of reflection. At this point there is a bifurcation - we either **reset**, or we ignore the signs our hearts and souls are giving us **(projected)**. Even when we reset, we run the risk of a repeated game where we continue to build up bad acts before having to reset again. If we ignore the signs, then we run the risk of completely losing ourselves. We become disconnected from the self from two fronts. The first is that we change in terms of how others view us (through the eyes of the other), and the second, we keep having to make projections of ourselves in hopes of converging to that future human. Or instead of having a "future self" we simply meander through time in a random manner like a drunkard.

If there is nothing to pin us down (let's call this a steady state), then life will become cyclical in the case of the **reset** option, or indeterminate in the case of the **projection** option when we ignore the soul's signals.

Many people use religion to pin down the self. Religion can lead to a form of determinism where the self becomes conformed into the religious person. With religion people practice and become disciplined. But this still does not lead a reduction in inadequacies. This only leads to a reduction in cycles in the **reset** case. As an example, becoming a hermit reduces outside influences, but forces you to live a life in isolation, removed from your natural environment (family, friends, and work). Doing certain things like working and socializing is part of who we are. We have evolved this way and these activities are necessary for us to continue to evolve. So, taking away certain things in some sense makes you even more inadequate (the exception is if you remove yourself from your environment temporally to learn something).

Balance is thus not running away from things or activities that are part of us, but rather to master them in a harmonious way. This requires us to do things such as socialize and work without making socialization and work our masters. It follows that you find yourself first, then you work and socialize in such a way that you do not lose yourself by losing the moral law.

Finding oneself is not easy. I have tried several ways. When you are yourself, you will have long-suffering, be kind, be gentle, be loving or charitable, be peaceful, be patient, be modest, be generous, have self-control, be chaste, be joyful and have faith. Resembling these characteristics mean that you will be able to suffer the insults of others, be thankful for the mercies in life, work well with others, create bridges, work hard, not give into every desire that hurts you in the long run and be calm when chaos ensues. While it is possible to be aware of these character traits, I realize that I do not possess them when I try to do things my way. My current self is not a sufficient pin to anchor my life. My current self is devoid of direction. The other does not give me the framework to converge to these elements. 

**Because I fall short of the moral law, and because my character traits are so flawed, and because I feel lost or out of touch with something within, I know that I am not myself.**

However, when I pray to Jesus and lay my life down to serve Him, then my mind is renewed, my soul reborn and my heart alive. For I realize that I cannot find myself, that only God can find me. And in finding me, He gives me all that I need to become myself. I am only that which constitutes me (as Kierkegaard would say) - and God is what constitutes me.

Why Jesus as the anchor of my life and not some other god? Only Jesus who is God lived out a sinless life by keeping the moral law. Only Jesus atoned for my inadequacies by being my substitute. Only Jesus forgives and restores. 

I know am wretched. My flesh is antagonizing me. It wants to rebel against God. But it is God that brings balance to that which is lost. I have sinned too much. Sinning once is enough to separate me from the love of God. But by His mercy He has restored me. By His mercy He forgives me. I owe everything to Him. He is my Lord. In Him there is balance. Life becomes bearable, only because He softens the joke. All glory to my Lord. Amen.
