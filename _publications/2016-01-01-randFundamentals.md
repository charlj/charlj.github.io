title: "The dynamic response of the rand real exchange rate to fundamental shocks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-01-01-randFundamentals
excerpt: 'The authors analyse the relationship between the South African real exchange rate and economic fundamentals – demand, supply and nominal shocks. The authors use a time-varying parameter VAR to study the coherence, conditional volatility and impulse responses of the exchange rate over specific periods and policy regimes. The model is identified using sign-restrictions that allow for some neutrality of impulse responses over contemporaneous and long horizons.'
