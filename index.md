<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>

### Predicting winners in a UFC bout: An example

[![Open Research Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/MMAStats.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify">Who wins in a UFC fight? It is really hard to predict given the dynamic and chaotic nature of the game. We present three simple models of picking winners. The first is to compute a simple win-loss statistic; the second uses past wins and losses against the type of opponent is a simple logistic function to pick a winner. The third tackles the problem structurally be modeling the endowment of each fighter and how the might react to an opponent's attack.</div>
